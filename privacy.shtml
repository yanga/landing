      <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
      <h5>This is the privacy policy (&ldquo;<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&rdquo;) that governs how we, Deep It Ltd. (&ldquo;<strong>Deep</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of (i) the website www.deep.it, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a &ldquo;<strong>Site</strong>&rdquo;); and (ii) the services and tools (collectively, "<strong>Service</strong>") provided by us to publishers of websites, mobile software applications, and other digital platforms and publications (such publishers, &ldquo;<strong>Publishers</strong>,&rdquo; and such websites, applications, platforms and publications, &ldquo;<strong>Publisher Websites</strong>&rdquo;), including the Publisher Websites which use our Service and the Deep widgets hosted on Publisher Websites (such widgets, "<strong>Widgets</strong>," and individuals who interact with our Site, Publisher Website and our Widgets, &ldquo;<strong>End Users</strong>&rdquo;).</h5>
      <h5>Certain portions of our Privacy Policy refer to the collection and use of information from visits and use of the Site and/or the dashboard we provide to Publishers through a web portal on our Site (such dashboard, &ldquo;<strong>Dashboard</strong>&rdquo;) and certain portions refer to information about End Users' visits and interactions with Publisher Websites or the Deep Widgets hosted on Publisher Websites. Provisions which refer to &ldquo;you&rdquo; or which do not specifically reference Publishers, Site users or End Users of Publisher Websites may refer to any or all of them.</h5>
      <h5>Please note that we do not ourselves host the Site and Services &ndash; all hosting is done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you (including any Personal Information, as defined below) &ndash; as further described in this Privacy Policy &ndash; is hosted with such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including the US). Data we collect may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that by using the Service or Site you consent to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including the US). </h5>
      <ol>
        <li>We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. &ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo; means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.</li>

Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent and Modification. </strong>You are not legally obligated to provide us Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that your providing us Personal Information is at your own free will. By visiting and using our Site, our Service or visiting or using the website of our customers (the Publisher Websites) or our Widgets hosted on Publisher Websites, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use our Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of our Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.</li>
        <li><strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.</strong> We receive and/or collect Personal Information in the following ways:
          <ol class="sub-list">
            <li><u>Service Registration and Account</u>. If you are a Publisher, in order to use and receive the Service, you must register for the Service through the Site and you must use an account (&ldquo;<strong>Account</strong>&rdquo;) to access the Dashboard, generate Widget Code and use other features of the Services. We may create an Account for you as part of the registration process for the Service, or you may be required to create the Account through a webpage we provide. To register for the Service and to create an Account, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as the Publisher's name and email address and the name and email address of the Publisher employee using the Account, the domain names of the Publisher Websites in connection with which you wish to use the Service, and a password that you will use for your Account. You may also choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of the Service or Account registration process and in connection with your ongoing use of your Account. We may send you a text message to your mobile phone or an e-mail to the e-mail address you submit to confirm your registration. If you choose not to create an Account, you may not be able to access or use certain features of the Service, including without limitation accessing the Dashboard and obtaining Widget Code, or use or register for the Service as a whole.
              <p>We may also offer you the option of creating or logging into your Account using your pre-existing account with a third-party website or service (a &ldquo;<strong>Third Party Account</strong>&rdquo;) such as Facebook or Google by clicking on a &lsquo;connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;sign-in&rsquo; or similar button that we may display on the Site. Clicking on such button will enable you to link your Account and your Third Party Account.</p>
              <p>If you chose to create or log in to your Account using your Third Party Account, you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that we obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account.</p>
              <p>If you log in using your Facebook Account, we may obtain your name, Facebook identification (ID) number, your profile picture, your gender, age range, locale and time zone, and e-mail address. You may disable or withdraw certain &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; in the settings section of your Facebook Account (on Facebook), but doing so may cause certain features of the Site or Service to become unavailable to you. In addition to the use of data described here, we may also use such data as described in Sections &lrm;&lrm;&lrm;5 (The Way We Use Personal Information) and &lrm;&lrm;&lrm;6 (Use of Anonymous Information) below. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE MAY KEEP DATA WE OBTAIN FROM FACEBOOK AS DESCRIBED ABOVE EVEN AFTER WE CEASE USING THE FACEBOOK PLATFORM OR OFFER FACEBOOK FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS FACEBOOK CONNECT OR LOGIN ON THE SITE. You also acknowledge and agree that even if you request that we delete personal information obtained from Facebook in connection with your Facebook Account, we may nevertheless retain Anonymous Information which was based on that information and use such information as described in this Section &lrm;&lrm;6.</p>
              <p>If you login using your Google Account, we may obtain your Google ID, your full name, your Google profile and profile image URL, and your Google email address and you agree to Google's API Terms of Service, available at <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/">https://developers.google.com/terms/</a>, any additional terms, policies or guidelines provided by Google as any of the foregoing may apply to you, as well as the collection of information about you and your activities on the Site by Google according to Google's Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>

            </li>
            <li><u>Purchases</u>. Our Site and the Dashboard may include the option for Publishers to purchase certain subscription options for the Service. If you choose to purchase a subscription through the Site or other features or products and services through the Dashboard, we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data if you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service providers.</li>
            <li><u>&lsquo;Contact Us&rsquo; Information</u>. If you send us a &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available on the Site or Dashboard or by sending an email to an address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name and email address.</li>
            <li><u>Log Files</u>. We may use log files to record activity on the Site and Dashboard. The information inside the log files may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Site and Service, track users&rsquo; movement around the Site and Services, and gather demographic information.</li>
            <li><u>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</u>. The Site and the Service may utilize &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order for us to provide our Service. A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Site, Dashboard, Publisher Websites and Widgets on a Publisher Website. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</li>
            <li><u>Analytics Services</u>. We may use third-party tools and services to collect and process information about use of the Site, Dashboard, Publisher Websites and Widgets hosted on Publisher Websites (&ldquo;<strong>Analytics Services</strong>&rdquo;). This includes information about how often users visit the Site, the Dashboard, Publisher Websites or the Widgets hosted on the Publisher Websites, what pages they visit when they do so, what users do on or with the Site, Dashboard, Publisher Website or Widgets, what other websites they used immediately prior and information about the user's device. We use the information we get from Analytics Services to maintain and improve our service and our products. These Analytics Services typically use cookies (see section &lrm;5 above) and include Google Analytics and Hot Jar, but may include other Analytics Services that we may use from time to time.
              <ol class="sub-list">
                <li><u>Google Analytics</u>. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to and use of the Site, Dashboard, Publisher Website, and the Widgets is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service, available at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>, and the Google Privacy Policy, available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.

                <li><u>Hot Jar.</u> HotJar is provided and hosted by HotJar Ltd., and is used to evaluate and analyze user activity and receive feedback from users. We use HotJar on our Site and Dashbaord, but not on Widgets embedded in Publisher Websites. HotJar receives device specific data, like your IP address (collected and stored in anonymous format), your device screen size, your country, your preferred language; log data such as the domain you visited which referred you, which pages you visit on a website and the time of the visits, your country and language.

        <li><strong>The Way We Use Personal Information. </strong>Whether you are a user of our Site, a Publisher using our Service, or an End User of our Widgets or a Publisher Website which hosts our Widgets, if you submit or we collect from you Personal Information, then we may use such Personal Information in the following ways, via any applicable communication channel, including e-mail, SMS, etc.:
          <ol class="sub-list">
            <li>We will use your Personal Information to provide and improve our Site and Service, and if you are a user of our Site or a Publisher using our Service, to send you marketing/advertisement communications that we believe may be of interest to you, to contact you in connection with the Site or Service and certain programs or offerings that you may have registered for, and to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Service that you are authorized to access.</li>

We require such Publishers to maintain privacy policies of their own and to use the information they receive from us in accordance with such privacy policies.</li>
            <li>We may transfer your Personal Information to our local or foreign subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of storing or processing such information on our behalf. Such information may be transferred to other countries. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</li>

Such information may be transferred to other countries. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</li>
            <li>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via our Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Deep, our users, yourself or the public.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Use of Anonymous Information.</strong> We may collect and use Anonymous Information (as defined below) about your activity on a Publisher Website, use of the Service, including your interaction with a Widget hosted on a Publisher Website, in order to improve, and enhance your experience with our Service, and any of our other products and services, or for any other reason.

If you choose not to provide mandatory Personal Information, you may still visit parts of the Site but you may be unable to access Widgets, the Dashboard, or certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you, or use the Service at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Access/Accuracy. </strong>To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information. If you would like to delete or correct certain of your other Personal Information that we may be storing, you may use the tools that we make available on the Service or you may submit an access request by sending an email to privacy@deep.it.

Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that you choose to use or interact with.</li>
        <li><strong>Children&rsquo;s Privacy. </strong>The Site, Service and our other products and services, are not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@deep.it">privacy@deep.it</a>.</li>
        <li>The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use reasonable acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on our Service, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@deep.it">info@deep.it</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.</strong> In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection with the foregoing events.</li>
        <li><strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

          <ol class="sub-list">
            <li><u>On Publisher Websites and Use of our Widgets</u>. We may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you use, or visit a Publisher Website which hosts our Widgets. In such a case, we do not currently respond or take any action with respect to a web browser's &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer&rsquo;s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. Except for our use of Analytics Services as stated in Section &lrm;6 above, we do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer&rsquo;s online activities when a consumer views or uses a website that hosts one of our Widgets.</li>
            <li>On the Site and Dashboard. We do not track consumers who use the Site (or Publishers who use the Dashboard), over time and across third party websites and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals with respect to use of the Site or Dashboard. Except for our use of Analytics Services as stated in Section <strong>&lrm;</strong>6&nbsp;above, we do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual Site users&rsquo; or Publishers&rsquo; online activities over time and across different web sites when using the Site or the Dashboard.&nbsp;</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deletion of Content from California Residents. </strong>If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or Personal Information you have publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information and you specify which content or Personal Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that after removal you will not be able to restore removed content. In addition, such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require us to enable removal of content.</li>
        <li>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or your Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@deep.it">privacy@deep.it</a>.</li>
